            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is like digital money that lives on the internet. You can’t touch or hold it, but you can use it to buy things online or even in some stores. It’s a new and exciting way of exchanging value without needing a bank. You’ve probably heard of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These are just two of the many cryptocurrencies that people use today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies use a technology called blockchain. Imagine a giant digital notebook that everyone can see but no one can change. Each time someone sends or receives cryptocurrency, it’s written in this notebook, making it very secure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Unlike regular money, no single person or bank controls cryptocurrencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer:</strong> You can send money directly to someone else without a middleman.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="why-use-crypto">
            <h2>Why Do People Use Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
            <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) focus on privacy. This means that your transactions are more secure and private compared to regular banking systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> Your money is protected by cryptographic codes.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Transactions:</strong> You can keep your identity and purchases private.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Global Access</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies can be used anywhere in the world, from big cities to small villages. All you need is an internet connection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Borders:</strong> Send and receive money globally without extra fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclusive:</strong> People without a bank account can use cryptocurrencies.</li>
